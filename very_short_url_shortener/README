## very_short_url_shortener
Someone asked if YOURLS is good.
Yeah it is. But it weight 3.7mb and is made of 482 files, which should be a pain to maintain
So I maked this as a start.
It can shorten links.
It can redirect if links exist.
A message is shown if no link are found.
It create files in the same folder, so the folder is the database.
You can use it with the bookmarklet provided.
Or just by happening your link to the url like this:
?to_short=http://A_very_LOONG_link
LIke YOURLS do. But in 1.5ko.
