## very_short_url_shortener
Someone asked if YOURLS is good.<br>
Yeah it is. But it weight 3.7mb and is made of 482 files, which should be a pain to maintain.<br>
So I maked this as a start.<br>
It can shorten links.<br>
It can redirect if links exist.<br>
A message is shown if no link are found.<br>
It create files in the same folder, so the folder is the database.<br>
You can use it with the bookmarklet provided.<br>
Or just by happening your link to the url like this:<br>
?to_short=http://A_very_LOONG_link<br>
LIke YOURLS do. But in 1.5ko.<br>
